Computer Vision for Financial Statement Analysis is an AI-based system that automatically extracts, processes, and analyzes financial information from scanned documents, PDFs, or images of financial statements. The project leverages Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to interpret visual data such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.

The system uses image preprocessing techniques (noise removal, thresholding, resizing), Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction, and deep learning models (such as CNNs and Transformer-based architectures) to identify and classify key financial elements like revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and profit margins.

The extracted data is then structured into machine-readable formats (CSV/JSON) for further financial analysis, trend detection, and automated reporting. This solution reduces manual data entry errors, improves processing speed, and enhances decision-making efficiency in financial institutions, auditing firms, and corporate finance departments.

🎯 Objectives:

Automatically detect and extract financial data from images/PDFs.

Classify and organize financial fields (assets, liabilities, revenue, etc.).

Perform automated ratio analysis and anomaly detection.

Generate structured outputs for business intelligence tools.
